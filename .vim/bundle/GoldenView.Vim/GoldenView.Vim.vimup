  >>> Introduction: 
 
  The initial motive for GoldenView comes from the frustration of using other vim plugins to autoresize split windows. The idea is deadly simple and very useful: resize the focused window to a proper size. However, in practice, many hiccups makes autoresizing not a smooth experience. Below are a list of issues I am trying to solve: 

  First and the most important one, autoresizing should play nicely with existing plugins like tagbar, vimfiler, unite, VOoM, quickfix, undotree, gundo, etc. These windows should manage there own window size. 

  Second, autoresizing should take care of the other windows too. Resizing the focused window may cause the other windows become too small. When you have 4+ split windows, autoresizing may just make a mess out of it. 




  >>> Features:

  GoldenView has preliminarily solved the issues described above. It also provides other features. Bascally, it does two things:

  1. Autoresizing

  First of all, it automatically resize the focused split window to a "golden" view based on golden ratio and textwidth.

  2. Tiled Windows Management

  Second, it maps a single key (<C-L> by default) to nicely split windows to tiled windows.

        ====+==============+============+===+
        |   |              |            |   |
        | F |              |    S1      | T |
        | I |              +------------| A |
        | L |  MAIN PANE   |    S2      | G |
        | E |              +------------+ B |
        | R |              |    S3      | A |
        |   |              |            |   |
        +===+==============+============+===+

  To get this view, just hit <C-L> 4 times. or, if you have a large monitor, you may get tiled windows below.

        | I |              |              +------------| A |

        | E |              |              +------------+ B |
        | R |              |              |    S3      | A |
        |   |              |              |            |   |

  To quickly switch between those windows, a few keys are mapped to

  - Focuse to the main window
  - Switch with the largest, smallest, etc.
  - Jump to next and previous window

  Requirements:
  - Vim 7.3 or later
