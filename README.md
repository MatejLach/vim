[Golang](http://golang.org)-centric ViM dev-environment:
==

![ViM as can be used for productive Go development](.github/vim-github_golang_ide.png)

This setup includes everything you'd expect for productive Go development; from project-aware autocompletion to integration of *go* tools, such as *gofmt* and *dodoc*.

**Included plugins**:

- colorschemes
- delimitMate
- FuzzyFinder
- gist-vim
- gundo
- mru
- l9.vim
- lightline.vim
- nerdtree
- pathogen.vim
- syntastic
- tagbar
- GoldenView
- ultisnips
- vim-fugitive
- vim-go
- vim-snippets
- webapi-vim
- YouCompleteMe


**Experimental plugins/not related to Go**:
- rust.vim (not Go but looks great, so why not have support for it?)
- racer.vim (experimental autocompletion for rust - may/may not work for you, requires [racer](https://github.com/phildawes/racer))

P.S. The colourscheme in the screenshot may differ from my current colourscheme in .vimrc.

Enjoy!
